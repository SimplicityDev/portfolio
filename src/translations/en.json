    "skill.dynamic.desc": "Who doesn't love a application where they can dynamically change what the user sees, be it user specific or be it general information. Dynamic content is beautiful, I personally, highly dislike static pages, what if something changes? What if it's dynamic, but is displayed on a static page? Are we really going to reload the entire thing? Let's not. Dynamic content is the way to go if you ask me.",

All these devices have a different surface area on which they can display a website, which is where the challenge lies, this being: ``How do I make sure this application is visible across all devices?``. The answer is simple, responsivesness. A lovely challenge if you ask me. ",
